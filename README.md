# blendicons

A new way to find free icons in a fun, simple and fast way for your projects. â€” just you and your creative work ðŸ˜Ž

Visit [blendicons.com](https://blendicons.com) if you want to know which icons you can use. At the moment the package only supports the _regular_ style.

## Installation

```sh
npm install blendicons --save
# or
yarn add blendicons
```

## Usage

```javascript
import { AAerialTramHangingWithCables } from 'blendicons/icons/regular/AAerialTramHangingWithCables';

function ReactComponent() {
  return <AAerialTramHangingWithCables />;
}
```

The names of the icons are the same as those you find on [blendicons.com](https://blendicons.com), but treated to not contain special characters and symbols and other obstacles that we would have when creating react components. Consider this when trying to find the icon in the package.

This package is designed to be used in conjunction with React and TypeScript.
